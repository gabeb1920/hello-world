My first Git repo

I'm Gabriel, a Bachelor of Computer Science student at the University of Wollongong in Australia.

I'm just getting started with GitHub and version control in general.

I'm planning to use this to manage a project I want to do of recreating the C++ STL. I want to do this so I get my head around the various parts of the STL as well as so I can use them for my assignments which sometimes do not allow STL use but would allow code I have written.
